# scripts README
---

This folder contains scripts that process raw data to make intermediate data and or figures.

They should contain none to minimal private functions that load or process data. Most code should be imported from the modules created above. The primary function of these scripts is to apply the functinos in the above modules to the data in an organized and static way.

When run, these scripts should generate a folder in the results folder that has a descritpive name, and the date the script was run (e.g., manifolds_2023-10-31). The date should be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
