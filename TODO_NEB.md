## TODO:

- Move over a lot of utility functions from my older NPX code. 
- Move over and comment the visualization functions from my notebooks
- Reorganize modules, scripts, notebooks.

## Optional:
- Migrate to IBL convertions (ONE, alf) and code base?
    - **Pros**
        - Code base will extend with the IBL.
        - Will likely be maintainable. 
        - Less likely to have bugs for common operations
    - **Cons** 
        - Startup cost of reorganizing the code base and data.
        - Have to stay up to date 
        - Installation can be tricky
